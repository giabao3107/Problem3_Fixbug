# Changes Made to Fix Issues

## Database Schema Fix

Fixed SQLite database schema syntax error with INDEX statements. SQLite requires CREATE INDEX statements to be separate from CREATE TABLE statements.

Changes made in `database/data_manager.py`:
- Moved all INDEX statements out of CREATE TABLE statements
- Created separate CREATE INDEX statements with proper naming (idx_table_column)
- Fixed all tables: signals, market_data, trades, and system_logs

## Telegram Bot Configuration

Updated Telegram bot configuration with the following credentials:
- Bot Token: `8047919251:AAH7-9j6_X08RpSPCQLMir_PVkkrx92ybdI`
- Chat ID: `1818962950`

To use these credentials:
1. Create a `.env` file in the project root
2. Copy the content from `env_example.txt`
3. Update the following lines:
   ```
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=8047919251:AAH7-9j6_X08RpSPCQLMir_PVkkrx92ybdI
   TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=1818962950
   ```

## All Symbols Monitoring

Added support for monitoring all symbols in HOSE, HNX, and UPCOM:

1. Updated `config/symbols.json`:
   - Added `"all_exchanges": true` flag to universe section
   - Updated metadata to reflect all symbols monitoring

2. Enhanced `utils/helpers.py`:
   - Modified `load_symbols()` function to fetch all symbols from vnstock library
   - Added support for fetching symbols by exchange (HOSE, HNX, UPCOM)
   - Created combined list of all symbols as `all_exchanges_list`

3. Updated `jobs/realtime_monitor.py`:
   - Modified symbol universe initialization to use all symbols when available
   - Added fallback to VN30 if all symbols can't be loaded

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Install Streamlit:
   ```
   pip install streamlit
   ```

3. Create `.env` file with your FiinQuant credentials and the provided Telegram bot details

4. Run the system:
   ```
   python main.py all
   ```

The system will now monitor all symbols from HOSE, HNX, and UPCOM exchanges and send alerts to the configured Telegram bot.
